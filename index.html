            Miles "Tails" Prower is a fictional character in Sega's Sonic the
            Hedgehog series, and the title character's best friend, sidekick,
            and most recurring ally. Tails also appears in his own spin-off
            series, comic books, cartoons, and films. He is the second character
            to consistently appear by Sonic's side in the series. The name
            "Miles Prower" is a pun on "miles per hour", a reference to the
            famed speed of Sonic the Hedgehog. He is a two-tailed fox, hence the
            nickname. A mechanical genius and skilled pilot,he can fly by
            spinning his tails like a helicopter rotor and can be seen flying in
            multiple games and TV shows created by Sega. He debuted with the
            release of the 8-bit version of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in October
            1992. In the mid-1990s, he was featured as the main character in a
            number of spinoff games: Tails and the Music Maker for the Sega
            Pico, and Tails Adventure and Tails' Skypatrol for the Game Gear.
            Tails was rated the third-most-popular character in the franchise,
            behind Sonic and Shadow, in an official poll from Sega in 2009.

          Sonic the Hedgehog is Sega's mascot and the eponymous protagonist of
          the Sonic the Hedgehog series. He is an anthropomorphic hedgehog born
          with the ability to run faster than the speed of sound, hence his
          name, and possesses lightning fast reflexes to match. As his species
          implies, Sonic can also roll up into a concussive ball, primarily to
          attack enemies. ver since stepping into the battle against iniquity,
          Sonic has been the champion of peace and is renowned all over the
          world for saving it countless times. During his many adventures, Sonic
          has traveled from the ends of the world to the far reaches of space
          and time, facing countless trials that have tested him to the fullest,
          earning him many titles, allies, and the scorns of several foes.
          Well-known for his legendary cocky attitude, easy-going demeanor and
          somewhat short temper, yet strong sense of justice, compassion, and
          love for freedom and adventure, Sonic uses his abilities to protect
          the innocent from his world and those beyond from the forces of evil,
          especially his arch-nemesis, Dr. Eggman.
